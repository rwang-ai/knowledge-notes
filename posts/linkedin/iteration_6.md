My Dev Process Is About to Fly

Over the past week, I experimented with Claude Code + MCP integrations—Playwright, Asana, and Google Drive—during a 3-day hackathon at work.

The MCP concept was initially a bit confusing, but once I grasped it, it made perfect sense: it’s just a standardized translation layer that lets an LLM connect to a service’s APIs (via API key or OAuth). That mental model removed cognitive friction, and my workflow started to feel like flying.

- Playwright MCP: When I ask Claude Code to build a feature, it now uses Playwright to verify the user flow and automatically fix any errors—including linter issues that used to require manual back-and-forth in Cursor. This creates an autonomous loop: build → verify → correct until the feature works as expected, saving effort and mental context-switching. I can even finish dinner prep while it runs.

- Asana MCP: After brainstorming an approach with Claude Code, the Asana MCP integration can spin up a fully fleshed-out project with milestones aligned to the final plan—in under 2 seconds. Claude even suggests high-quality deliverables. What used to take several minutes of tedious setup is now fully automated—  a truly delightful experience.

- Google Drive MCP: I also set up Google Drive MCP, which can read project briefs and give Claude Code the context it needs to make more thorough recommendations across tasks.

I’m on call in 2 days and can’t wait to try Sentry MCP with Claude Code — to see if it can become a true second brain, reduce context switching, and make work even more fun.
