Learning in Public Series #8

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been deliberately reflecting on and iterating my development workflow—using Claude Code as my main partner, 
along with a few other tools. What I’ve realized is that AI is most useful when paired with structure: each stage of the product development
 cycle benefits in a different way.

Highlights from my workflow experiments:

- Product Feature Alignment – Prototyping beats text. v0 is surprisingly effective at turning fuzzy feature ideas into concrete conversations with stakeholders.
- Writing PRDs – ChatPRD has been a delight. It guides you through refining business goals, user goals, and user stories, while keeping formatting simple and readable.
- Development Planning – Claude Code shines as a thought partner. Instead of just asking it to “vibe out” code, I found it most effective to break work into structured steps: each with a clear functional goal, what to change, and how to verify. Holding a high bar here directly improves code quality and reduces prompt iterations.
- Test-First Development – A small but powerful shift. Claude can overshoot with too many tests, but if you co-plan an optimal test set first, future feature changes are more accurate and predictable.
- PR Review – Pairing Claude Code with GitHub MCP has made reviews tighter and faster, helping you get context on parts of the codebase you don’t normally touch.

Key Learnings
- Structured review with AI is what turns output into production-grade code.
- Test-first workflows work really well with assistive coding tools.
- Reflection—and applying new learnings to tweak how you use the tools—is genuinely fun.

AI amplifies disciplined engineers who are willing to iterate, experiment, and learn.
