Using Deepwiki to Chunk GitHub Repos Faster — A Cognitive Psychology Hack

At startups, the real challenge isn’t finding open source tools—it’s deciding which are worth leveraging.

Last year, while building our LLM evaluation tools, I explored projects like openai/evals, deepeval, and others—and hit a steep learning curve. Most concepts were unfamiliar, repo structures opaque, and I spent hours digging through code just to understand each framework’s purpose and whether it made sense to adopt.

It was slow, messy, and mentally draining.

What I was missing was effective chunking—a core cognitive psychology principle that groups complex information into meaningful units, cutting cognitive load and speeding understanding.

I wish I had known about Deepwiki back then.

Now, instead of parsing file-by-file, I can:

Get a high-level visual map of the repo
Understand how the pieces fit together
Ask questions to clarify design decisions and edge cases
It’s like having a tour guide for any codebase—letting me skip the busywork and focus on evaluating utility and fit.

Bonus move: when I find a high-quality cheatsheet repo—like this TypeScript cheatsheet for React basics—I run it through Deepwiki. It’s like chunking the chunk—fast context-building that sharpens my mental model and reveals gaps in my stack. This approach helped me gain working proficiency in React/TypeScript faster than expected.
