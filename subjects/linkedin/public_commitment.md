Learning in Public, and writing imperfectly

As I reflect on the first half of 2025, time in the era of AI feels faster than ever. My GitHub contribution graph shows momentum—and this journey is only beginning.

For the second half of 2025, I’m committing to learn in public by writing 20 posts about how I use LLMs and tools—primarily to explore learning methods that work best for me, through the lens of self-awareness, psychology, behavior, and cognitive science. My goal is to reduce cognitive overload, deepen effective learning, and, most importantly, enjoy the process every day.

The idea of a 10x engineer has always inspired me. Now, AI makes that possible—not just 10x productive, but 10x happier. That drives me forward.

Learning in public keeps me accountable and helps me break out of automatic, reactive living.

If you’re also using AI to deepen your learning and growth, I’d be interested to hear about your experience.
