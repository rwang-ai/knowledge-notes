Learning in Public Series #2
Compressing Dense Knowledge Without Losing Depth

Some of the best learning resources today are on YouTube. Talks like Andrej Karpathy’s LLM deep dives or Lenny Rachitsky’s product interviews are packed with insight and nuance—but they often run for hours.

Even if you manage to get through them, cognitive psychology makes one thing clear: without spaced repetition, most of that knowledge will fade within a week. Spending 4–5 hours on every interesting topic just isn’t possible.

That’s where Google NotebookLM has been surprisingly helpful. You can feed it YouTube videos or articles, and it generates summaries, highlights key points, and helps reinforce your understanding.

Recently, our CEO shared a video from Lenny on prompt engineering. After listening to the episode, I ran it through NotebookLM to extract key takeaways. It is much eaiser to narrow down the suggested techquies haven't been adopted in our product or my personal workflow.

I’ve also started clustering content by topic and asking the LLM to synthesize different perspectives. Adding short study notes helps me revisit key ideas quickly. It’s not perfect—but it’s a clear step forward in how I learn and apply new ideas.
