Learning in Public Series #7

Agentic AI Hackathon

Last weekend our company hosted a 3-day hackathon exploring agentic AI features.

Our team was a mix of Austin, our Chief of Staff (ex-PM), Debbie, our designer, and me (engineer). The challenge: experiment with new AI tools and see what impactful product features we could build.

A few highlights from those three days:
- On day one, Austin wrote a multi-page PRD with production-level clarity—each sub-feature captured in its own one-pager. At first I thought, “Do we really want to spend this much time on PRD?” But when he fed it into Lovable, the prototype that came back was surprisingly comprehensive and impressive.
- Even though we provided our existing site’s screenshots, Lovable’s generated UI was… ugly. Debbie had to step in with detailed Figma design before the UX improved.
- A few months ago I hand-built a LangChain React Agent—it took me two full days of trial and error. This time, I asked Claude Code to reference that example, and the agent worked almost out of the box. That freed me to focus on MCP integration feasibility and UX iteration, while Claude handled most of the scaffolding automatically. It just worked.

Key learnings:
- Prompting matters—but so does domain knowledge. Expertise isn’t optional; it’s what makes AI outputs useful.
- Few-shot examples are incredibly effective.
- Design/UX is critical to building a successful product.
- As “doing” gets cheaper, learning becomes a key professional skill. The more willing you are to embrace change and trial-and-error, the more you can ride the AI wave.

In the end, our team won the “Highest Ceiling Award”—very rewarding.
