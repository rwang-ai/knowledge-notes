The Non-Technical Side of Learning AI

Learning AI isn’t just technical—it requires navigating your own psychology.

Over time, I’ve found two main factors that matter most to me:

1. Being around people who are ahead, driven, and constantly learning

My friend Haifeng is an expert in AI/LLMs and the first in my circle to adopt Cursor and then Claude Code. Hearing about his experiments and insights makes me eager to try them myself. His drive pulled me forward.

2. Learning is change, and change means overcoming inertia—and environment plays a big role

Learning is a vulnerable activity—it requires patience and space to grow. It wasn’t until I joined the Rising team that I started to get over the hurdle and really began having AI help me leap forward. When I first met our CTO, Jeff Yang, he said, “Nowadays, everyone needs to learn.”

This simple statement gave me permission to focus on learning without worrying about looking perfect. Over time, he introduced Cursor and Claude Code into our daily work, giving me the opportunity to practice regularly. A psychologically safe culture with leaders who embrace learning and change made a huge difference.

After all, we tend to become like the six people we spend the most time with.

I’m still early in my AI learning journey. If I can help others along the way, I’d love to pay it forward.
